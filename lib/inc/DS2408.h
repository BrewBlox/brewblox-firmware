 * Each output has a pull-down transistor, which can be enabled by writing 0 to the pio output latch.
 * This pulls the output pin to GND.

 * When the output latch is disabled, the pio can be read as digital input (sense).
 * This is the power on-default if a reset signal is pulled low. Without reset, the state is random.
