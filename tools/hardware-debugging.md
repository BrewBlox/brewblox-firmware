# Hardware debugging in NetBeans
On-target hardware debugging requires a hardware debugger (ST-Link V2) and a 
small board to connect the ST-Link to the Spark Core.
You can find details on how to setup NetBeans for debugging here:
https://community.spark.io/t/local-development-and-debugging-a-step-by-step-guide/7829


##
To recompile the project with SWD enabled append this to the make command in Netbeans:

```
USE_SWD=y
```

and do a clean build.

Upload SWD enabled build result via DFU. Put core in DFU mode, run:

```
make program-dfu
```
This should find brewpi.dfu and upload it over USB.

When starting st-util, you should now see this line:

```
Chip ID is 00000410, Core ID is 1ba01477.
```
If the chip ID comes back as 00000000 you do not have SWD enabled.

# Uploading with with 1 button click

A script is available to do all steps needed.
Run ```program-via-gdb.sh``` from a shell (terminal window in Netbeans).

This will start a gdb server with st-util, connect to it with arm gdb and then load the .elf file.
Make sure st-util is in the PATH.

To be able to upload via the Run button in Netbeans, set the Run command to:
```
./program-via-gdb.sh
```
And the run directory to
```
tools
```

# Hardware debugging
To step debug on target, you will have to:

- set the Gdb Init File in the projects Debug settings to gdb-attach.txt
- load your .elf to the core the Run button (see above)
- start st-util listening on port 9025: st-util -p 9025
- set a breakpoint that you are sure you will hit (pause is not working yet)
- attach to to the debugger in Netbeans with the gdbserver plugin with target ```remote localhost:9025```


## Cloning eeprom data for debugging
On problem Spark:
```
docker pull brewblox/firmware-flasher:edge
docker run --privileged -it --rm -v /dev:/dev brewblox/firmware-flasher:edge trigger-dfu
docker run --privileged -it --rm -v /dev:/dev -v /home/pi/brewblox/:/dump -v /dev:/dev brewblox/firmware-flasher:edge -c "dfu-util -d 2b04:d006 -a 0 -s 0x800C000:0x18000 -U /dump/eeprom.bin"
curl https://bashupload.com/eeprom.bin --data-binary @/home/pi/brewblox/eeprom.bin
```

On a test spark with a hardware debugger:
st-flash write eeprom.bin 0x800c000
